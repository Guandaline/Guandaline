# 👋 Hi, I'm Valter Hugo Guandaline

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Platform Architect** passionate about building AI systems that are scalable, reliable, and production-ready.  
Over 13+ years, I've worked across **AI Engineering**, **Backend Architecture**, and **Distributed Systems**, helping companies bring real AI products to life.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

I work at the intersection of **LLMs, infrastructure and engineering**, building systems that turn models into real products.

### 🔹 **Machine Learning Engineering**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Evaluation & Observability for LLMs  
- Vector databases, embeddings pipelines  
- Fine-tuning and model specialization  
- Prompt engineering and safety layers  

### 🔹 **LLM & AI Infrastructure**
- Fast, resilient service layers for AI workloads  
- Caching, batching, multiplexing, and throughput optimization  
- Distributed architectures for inference + data processing  
- Secrets, config, multi-environment orchestration  

### 🔹 **Backend & Systems Engineering**
- High-performance APIs (FastAPI / Python)  
- Event-driven systems with Kafka  
- Storage, caching, and consistency patterns  
- Observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus)  
- Robustness: retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, CQRS, outbox

## 🚀 Current Work: **Athomic** 
[See the docs](https://guandaline.github.io/athomic-docs/)

I'm building **Athomic**, a modern backend framework specialized for AI-native and data-intensive applications.

Focus areas include:
- LLM pipelines (streaming, tools, RAG, workflows)
- First-class observability for AI systems  
- Resilient messaging + consistency guarantees  
- Polyglot persistence for AI workloads  
- Extensible plugin architecture  

> Public release coming soon.

## 🌐 Side Project: Open Omni-Cloud

I maintain the Open Omni-Cloud initiative as a **research project** into verifiable cloud-agnostic architectures, similar to a "TCK for multi-cloud".
