# 👋 Hi, I'm Valter Hugo Guandaline

I'm an experienced **AI/ML Engineer** and **Technology Leader** with over 13 years of experience building scalable backend architectures and data-centric systems.

My mission is to solve the broken promise of multi-cloud by replacing marketing buzzwords with verifiable, engineering-first standards. I’m passionate about bridging **applied AI**, **distributed systems**, and **developer experience** — turning complex technologies into reliable, elegant software.

### 🚀 My Main Focus: Open Omni-Cloud | Athomic

I'm the founder of the **Open Omni-Cloud** initiative, a community-driven project to create a verifiable standard for truly cloud-agnostic architectures. Our goal is to make cloud portability a guaranteed property, not a marketing claim.
